# Files related to the NMRlipids III project 

This repository contains files related to the [NMRlipids III](www.nmrlipids.blogspot.fi) project where lipid(POPC)-cholesterol interactions in different force fields are evaluated againts experimental NMR and X-ray scattering data. 

NMR data is taken from [DOI: 10.1039/C2CP42738A]( https://doi.org/10.1039/C2CP42738A) and is available at [DATA/EXP-Ferreira13/S_CH_POPC](https://github.com/NMRLipids/NmrLipidsCholXray/tree/master/DATA/EXP-Ferreira13/S_CH_POPC). X-ray scattering data is contributed to this project and is available at [DATA/EXP-XrayScattering/](https://github.com/NMRLipids/NmrLipidsCholXray/tree/master/DATA/EXP-XrayScattering/).

Manuscript summarizing the main results can be found from here: https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-kz2lk
