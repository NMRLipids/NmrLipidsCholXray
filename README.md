# Files related to the NMRlipids III project 

This repository contains files related to the NMRlipids III project where lipid(POPC)-cholesterol interactions in different force fields are evaluated againts experimental NMR (from [DOI: 10.1039/C2CP42738A]( https://doi.org/10.1039/C2CP42738A), available at [DATA/EXP-Ferreira13/S_CH_POPC](https://github.com/NMRLipids/NmrLipidsCholXray/tree/master/DATA/EXP-Ferreira13/S_CH_POPC)) and X-ray scattering (available at [DATA/EXP-XrayScattering/](https://github.com/NMRLipids/NmrLipidsCholXray/tree/master/DATA/EXP-XrayScattering/)) data.
